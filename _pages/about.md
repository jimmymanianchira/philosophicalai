Hi! I am Jimmy Jose. I like to think of myself as an Epiceureanist with a fascination for Stoicism. You see the contradiction there don't you? ;) I like complexities, contradictions and AI. While not lost in thoughts, I work as an AI Engineer/AI Scientist/Data Scientist (Gee. Come on we need to fix some naming conventions for the industry). Here I mainly  plan on writing mostly about AI and a bit of where AI & Philosophy interlinks.
