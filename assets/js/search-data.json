            "title": "What is Document Intelligence",
            "content": "Rewind . I first heard of Document Intelligence about 3 years back when I heard leaders at EY talk about the importance of building document intelligence solutions. Back then I didn&#39;t understand the difference between this so called Document Intelligence and the NLP I was working on. I was working on NLP on documents and to me the whole world of NLP just meant that. I just couldn&#39;t fathom the idea that NLP systems would be all around me making my life while intruding on my privacy. . Flash forward to today and most people still confuse &#39;Document Intelligence&#39; with &#39;NLP&#39;. So let&#39;s clear the difference shall we? . So what is Document Intelligence? . According to me, Document Intelligence is a term used to descibe any set of AI Techniques that can be used to understand, extract and generate insights from business documents. But if you don&#39;t like my definition here have a look at definition from folks who wrote &#39;LayoutLM&#39; . &quot;Document AI, or Document Intelligence, is a relatively new research topic that refers techniques for automatically reading, understanding, and analyzing business documents&quot; . And if you noticed the definition above, you would have realized there isn&#39;t much talk about NLP. And the reason is simply because Doc Intel isn&#39;t just about NLP. It is a lot more! But it&#39;s confusing a bit because documents are full of text isn&#39;t it and for solving text don&#39;t we use NLP? . Let&#39;s go back a bit shall we? Documents contain more than text. It can have colorful pictures, excel screenshots containing whole lot of numbers, maybe we can mix some powerpoint slides too. Documents are more than text. It is information condensed within pictures and tables and free flowing text. . To solve Doc Intelligence, we need to know different types of documents. Thankfully currently Doc Intelligence only limits itself to business documents. So I guess that cuts down the scope a bit. . To get a decent idea of the type of Documents, its a good idea to look at the RVL-CDIP Dataset (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/rvl-cdip/). This dataset could be considered as the ImageNet of Doc Intelligence. It consists of 400,000 grayscale images. Damn! . But how come the documents are images? Well turns out scanned copies are images and a lot of times business documents are a bunch of scanned images from the long past glued together. Business documents are not just colorful powerpoints MBA grads make. It also consists of the insurance forms a broker scans and sends on his phone after meeting the customer. Trust me when I say this, business documents come in all flavours and shape. Recently I was working on a set of documents consisting of hand-written bills, screenshots from a Database, freshly colourful bills along with a very desciptive letter in between. And all this was there in the same document and imagine building a system which can make sense from all these different type of documents. As a Doc Intel Practioner,I hope it is not arrogant to say Doc Intel is tough. . It is due to the above reasons RVL-CDIP is considered Imagenet. It is big and it contains image belong to around 16 different classes of documents. And best part is a lot of these images have really bad clarity which is also synonymous with how the documents in the industry look like. . Here is a snapshot of the RVL-CDIP dataset. . . Now that we know what a &#39;Document&#39; means. Lets look at a bit of what industry wants to do with Documents. . 1) Legal - Who doesn&#39;t love lawyers? I sure do. Not because half of my school classmates are lawyers and I love arguing with them about how AI is going to partially automate their jobs. But jokes apart, Doc Intel is going to kill it in legal. I have worked with projects in which we wanted to help lawyers find out specific information from 100-200 page contracts. Imagine giving a contract to an AI system and AI system instantly spits out the information which the lawyer wants to see. This is extremely difficult because of the sheer size of the documents combined with the legal verbiage which is hard for a layman to understand. But with each passing day, its getting simpler with the advancement in NLP. . 2) Insurance- Whenever I have met any insurance agent, they asked me to fill a lot of forms. Now someone is going to take these forms, fill out the values from the forms in a computer somewhere. Now imagine, if the broker just takes a photo of the form on his phone, a backend AI system understands what each answer in the form corresponds to and automatically populates the table of the interest. We saved a lot of time didn&#39;t we? . I am sure you are aware of more usecases. So let&#39;s not delve on that. Assuming that we have a document from which we want to extract some information, lets look at the DOC Intel Pipeline . Doc Intel Pipeline . To extract information from Documents, we need a system which can do a bunch of things. And this is where we see that &#39;Doc Intel&#39; is not just NLP. Its more than that. Infact we can think of Document Intelligence as a set of five steps. Let&#39;s dive into each one of them. . Document Pre-Processing . So we have a document, or is it a bunch of images stored in a folder? First step is to get our document ready. If we are lucky our document will be in one piece, otherwise we will need to write a bit of python code to combine our images into 1 single pdf. Turns out our PDF is scanned. No issues! The next step in our pipeline will take care of it. But wait our scanned document is full of noise. Some images have very low clarity( An example below). Now imagine an image like this along with a bunch of lines and a whole lot of random noise all over it. Will Modern OCR systems be able to extract text correctly from these kind of images? Tesseract the most popular open source OCR will certainly have issues. But Professional Vendors will be a bit more luckier. But even professional vendors are going to have challenges when dealing with languages other than english. . . So how are we going to convert our messy little image into a clear image which can be then send for OCR? Careful playing around with OpenCV can result in getting rid of a lot of noise. But why not have a Deep Learning Neural Network do it for you? Today with Generative Adversial Networks(GANS), people are converting Black &amp; White Images to Color Images. What&#39;s essentially happening there is a image transformation. . . Just like above, we can build a neural network which converts a low clarity image from a document into a high clarity image. How do we do that? Take a bunch of normal documents, convert them into images. Now onto these images add a bunch of noise, draw some lines, get creative folks! Now once your creativity is done, give the creative image as input to our model and the original image as output. Once we have a properly trained model, we can give the model noisy images and it can give us back &#39;noise-less&#39; images. This technique isn&#39;t fool proof. Like any model, our model will also make mistakes. But something is better than nothing right? And the best thing about this technique is this can be applied for any language. Greatest value-add from this technique comes for languages in which OCR sucks(which is a lot). . Now that we have our &#39;noise-less&#39; images, lets stich them back together into a pdf and go to the next step . . OCR . OCR or Optical Character Recgonition is a very simple thing which people seem to confuse a lot. An OCR tool converts the text in images to a readable format for computers. So if I have a scanned image, OCR will extract all the text from the image to a text or word or any other file of my liking. But OCR systems apart from providing text they also provide the position of text in the image. This position information is very important for 2 reasons . For the end-user to locate the text in the document | For certain problems, considering text only won&#39;t help.We also need to look at the position of text with respect to other text. | Thankfully this step of the pipeline does not need us to build much. Tesseract is the most popular open-source OCR tool out there. It supports around 100 languages( accuracy can be a bit challenging in most languages). . Azure OCR, Omnipage, Abbyy are some of the other popular OCR vendors out there. All 3 seems to perform better than Tesseract. . So what about handwritten documents? Tesseract seems to perform really badly on them an the professional vendors seem to be getting better at it. . If OCR output is bad, it affects pretty much all downstream tasks. And since most solutions today treating OCR as a blackbox, it makes more sense to invest on the &#39;Document Pre-Processing&#39; step to better the input which goes into the OCR. . . OCR Post Processing . OCR Output can be a text or word file or an hocr(some other format for professional vendors). When I was young(still I am young at heart ), I used to wonder why anyone would generate the complicated hocr output on the top. In fact, it will be easier to extract everything from a text file. Ohh god, I was wrong. Extracting information can be painful from a text file because layout can go for a toss. And remember, we are converting a complicated messy pdf into a text file. This results in loss of information which can cause a lot of issues. Hence most of the time we will be processing the hocr/xml file to extract the text. . Extracting from hocr/xml file has a couple of benefits. . It contains the bounding box of each word. Would be extemely useful if we plan on highlighting the information in another downstream layer | It might group a paragraph under 1 tree, which enables us to extract 1 paragraph at a time easily. | But there are some problems which are not easy to solve- . Cannot directly extract tables from pdfs using hocr output.Tables require a completely different strategy | Charts,pictures all suffer from the same problem as above | What do we do, if paragraphs or tables get split across multiple pages | The problems, I listed above are very difficult problems which are active areas of research. One interesting post-processing solution to the above problem is one which involves Computer Vision. . Layout Detection . When we look at a document, our eyes are clearly able to detect what the title is, where the chart locates and so on. And the way we treat these different objects in a document are also different. This is the fundamental idea of &#39;Layout Detection&#39;. If we have a model which can detect the different types of objects in a document, we can have custom code to extract these different objects from the document. . Sounds simple right? . To build a generic layout detection model is extremely difficult because of the large complexity of &#39;Documents&#39; and like all industries, getting labelled data is extremely painful. But thankfully there exists the &#39;DocBank&#39;Dataset and alternatives. . . DocBank is one of the datasets which contains images along with annotations. A simple solution, will be to build a object detection model on top of &#39;DocBank&#39; Dataset. This model can then be used in our documents to find out position of various objects. Once position has been found, we can write &#39;custom code&#39; to extract them. . But this &#39;custom code&#39; has its own complexities varying based on the object. Paragraphs are simple to extract but when paragraphs get&#39;s split across pages, it can be quite troublesome. . The Post Processing module is an important component which helps us extract text or other information in a format which can be useful for downstream tasks. But unfortuantely its far from solved and let&#39;s hope to see more update in this area. . Intelligence . Finally we reach the &#39;Intelligence&#39; component of &#39;Doc Intelligence&#39;. But it&#39;s a bit unfair on the other components to call this component alone the &#39;Intelligence&#39; component because every other component is using some amount of Machine Learning. But as far as business user is concerned, this is the component which gives him value. . As a Document Intelligence Practioner, this is one of our biggest hurdles. Because most of the time from a project estimation, everyone expects only the &#39;Intelligence&#39; component to take time. They think rest of the components can be done in a week. But enough about my rant. . So the &#39;Intelligence&#39; component is the one in which we extract business value. In a Doc-Intel pipeline, this is the component which changes most based on use-case. . Lets look at a sample use-case and proceed from that. I have a set of documents from which I need to answer certain questions. . For eg- I have an audit report. These are some of the questions, I want to answer . Who is the curent auditor? | When will auditor rotation took place? | The output of the &#39;OCR Post-Processing&#39; module will be an csv file(could be anything) containing the list of paragraphs. Now I need to build a component which can extract the answers for the questions above. Let&#39;s imagine how we as humans will solve for this particular problem. Our approach will be to first find the paragraphs which we are interested in. Once we have found paragraphs which we think will have the answer, we will then see if the answer exists. . Our intelligence compoent does exactly the same. It will first try to find a set of paragraphs which might contain the answer and then another module will see if the answer exists or not in the paragraph and if it does, it will extract the paragraph. . From an NLP perspective, we have 2 modules which will do the steps above. . Retriever Model . Retriever does exactly what the name suggests. It retrieves top paragraphs from around 200-300 paragraphs. An audit report can contain somewhere between 100-200 pages. And for simplicity, lets assume each page contains around 4 paragraphs. So we are looking at somewhere between 400-800 paragraphs. The next component which follows the retriever module, is a compute and memory intensive operation. So sending 400-800 paragraphs to it is a pure waste of compute and time. Hence the need for the retriever model. . Retriever model is essential trying to find the most similar paragraphs to our question. The easiest way to do it is using &#39;Tf-IDF&#39; vectorizer. We build a vectorizer over the entire list of paragraphs and then measure the cosine similarity between our input question and list of top similar paragraphs. We then send the list of paragraphs to the next module. . Question Answering Module . Just like the retriever model, the Q&amp;A module also lives upto its name. Given a question, it will give you answers from paragraphs. I won&#39;t go into the specifics of Q&amp;A module here. But a Q&amp;A module, at a high level is trying to take the question and a paragraph and its locating the answer to that question in a paragraph. A lot of basic Q&amp;A models are trained today on the Squad Dataset. . NLP has progressed a lot in the last 1 year and the benefit of that is we can take existing models from the internet and do inference on our dataset. Training Q&amp;A models on a specific domain will yield better results but models from the internet also tend to perform well because of the sheer amount of data they are trained on. . The easiest way to use a Q&amp;A model is the transformers library from hugginface. They come with a huge set of pre-trained models and have managed to abstract a lot of the model complexity, thus enabling even beginners to use it. Please find below an example. . . The above mentioned way was one way of building a system which can answer questions from a document. But I am not saying its the best approach. In fact the best approach will be based on the domain, the complexity of questions and documents and the compute requirements. . Now if we wanted to build an Intelligence system which can extract information from &#39;Forms&#39;, we would need to come up with a completely different model. &#39;Layoutlm&#39; comes to mind. But I will save that for another post. . Essentially this component, changes based on the requirement. I am of the opinion, in the coming years we will have models which will be able to extract from all type of documents. But until then, we will need to develop different type of models for each use case. . Document Viewer (Optional) . If AI was truly smart, we wouldn&#39;t need this component. But fortunately or unfortunately, AI isn&#39;t smart which forces us to build this component. . Document Viewer is just a component which can be used to view the document in a UI. Ofcourse it isn&#39;t just the document, it will also show the model outputs(which is what we want to extract). . . Doc Viewer servers 2 purposes- . It enables the user to verify the model output. Not all industries would like an AI system to predict values which will determine decision making without any verification. A domain expert can validate the model output before sending it to the next system. For eg- a lawyer can use a Doc Intel tool to answer certain questions from a 100-200 page contract. Normally answering these questions would probaly take a day. But the Doc Intel system will be able to do this in seconds or minutes. Laywer would just need to verify the model output. If its incorrect, he wil change it. This way he is getting massive time savings and with doc viewer in place, the end output will be always right | As everyone knows, today&#39;s models love data. Infact you need to keep pumping him/her data. With Doc Viewer in place, user validates the model output. This validated model output can than be used again as training data | But truth be told not a lot of systems use the document viewer because there are people who trust the model to give 100% accuracy all the time or they are fine with system getting the answer wrong every once in a while. For them, doc viewer is an additional overhead component. . Some closing thoughts? . We had discussed five different components of the Doc Intel pipeline. For all these components, we didn&#39;t look much at any professional vendors. But there exists professional vendors for most of these components. A production Doc Intel pipeline thus could contain components from third party vendors. This could at times makes integration challenging. But the good news for Doc Intel Practioner is that he has a lot of options to pick from. As the market evolves we are seeing more and more players entering. Keeping in track of them is quite challenging. Do share your favorite components in the comments. . Last 1 year has been a year of disruption in our personal and professional lives. Companies which were inflexible when it comes to &#39;work-from-home&#39; are paying the price. This is the same for companies who haven&#39;t paid much attention to digitization too. We are seeing more companies move towards &#39;less-paper&#39; approach. And this is ultimately going to result in more &#39;Document Intelligence&#39; projects. I guess it isn&#39;t going to be a good time for the lazy &#39;Doc Intel&#39; practioner. . Hope you liked the post on Doc Intel. Let me know your thoughts in the comments. ;) And before I close, let me share a bit of stoic wisdom. . “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact.

            "title": "Exploring HotPot QA",
            "content": "When you look at Squad Leaderboard, we are given an impression that problem of Question &amp; Answering is solved. I mean a F1 score of 93.011 when compared to human performance(89.452), damn those are some impressive numbers. I am sure a media person might see those numbers and say we have machines which can beat humans at Question &amp; Answering. . But Q&amp;A is far from solved and that&#39;s the reason why we are getting datasets like MultiHopQA. I don&#39;t want to discuss about the fact that high performance on SQUad doesn&#39;t mean the best model on single paragraph question answering because datasets like TydiQa do talk about that a bit(Idea for next blog post ;)). . But let&#39;s look at another issue with Q&amp;A models built on top of Squad. In every single case in Squad, we are answering question based on 1 single paragraph. But think of using the same Q&amp;A model to get answers from a document. . Ouch we have ran into a problem now haven&#39;t we. To answer a question in a document, the model has to look at multiple places and our Squad trained model will have issues there. . Ps. I have used squad models on 100+ page documents and the model does well for certain type questions . And to address this problem, we have HotPotQA. Lets look at how HotPotQA differs from its peers . First, some datasets mainly focus on testing the ability of reasoning within a single paragraph or document, or single-hop reasoning.* TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017)and SearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017) create a more challenging setting by using information retrieval to collect multiple documents to form the context given existing question-answer pairs. Nevertheless, most of the questions can be answered by matching the question with a few nearby sentences in one single paragraph, which is limited as it does not require more complex reasoning. Third, all of the above datasets only provide distant supervision; i.e., the systems only know what the answer is, but do not know what supporting facts lead to it . Once we have models solved for Second &amp; Third problem, I am of the belief we are going to see a NLP boom in corporate firms. For everyone complaining about lack of explainibility the context of supporting information will be a welcome relief. . Well until then lets do a bit of exploration shall we? .

Note- Anything in Italics is taken directly from the paper found here- https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/yang2018hotpotqa.pdf . So how did the authors collect such a challenging dataset? . Any dataset is only good as the technique they used for collecting dataset. . The main goal of our work is to collect a diverse and explainable question answering dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning. . I am in all for the goal. . The overall setting is that given some context paragraphs (e.g., a few paragraphs, or the entire Web) and a question, a QA system answers the question by extracting a span of text from the context, similar to Rajpurkar et al. (2016). We additionally ensure that it is necessary to perform multi-hop reasoning to correctly answer the question. . So i short it seems, the dataset has a bunch of paragraphs for a question and to answer the question a system or model will need to look at multiple paragraphs. . In our pilot studies, we found that simply giving an arbitrary set of paragraphs to crowd workers is counterproductive, because for most paragraph sets, it is difficult to ask a meaningful multi-hop question. To address this challenge, we carefully design a pipeline to collect text-based multi-hop questions. . They seem to have given a lot of thought into what&#39;s the best way to collect data. . Building a Wikipedia Hyperlink Graph. We use the entire English Wikipedia dump as our corpus. In this corpus, we make two observations: (1) hyper-links in the Wikipedia articles often naturally entail a relation between two (already disambiguated) entities in the context, which could potentially be used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning; (2) the first paragraph of each article often contains much information that could be queried in a meaningful way. Based on these observations, we extract all the hyperlinks from the first paragraphs of all Wikipedia articles. With these hyperlinks, we build a directed graph G, where each edge (a, b) indicates there is a hyperlink from the first paragraph of article a to article b. . Their approach has to be to use Wikipedia to build a graph and that too in a very simple manner. They look at first paragraph of each article and looks at its hyperlinks and builds a graph where an edge represents there is an hyperlink between 2 paragraphs. . Given an edge (a, b) in the hyperlink graph G, the entity of b can usually be viewed as a bridge entity that connects a and b. . I like where this is going. Its natural paragraph &#39;b&#39; will be connected to paragraph &#39;a&#39; because there is an hyperlink between both. But it shouldn&#39;t work for all cases right? . Entities like countries are frequently referred to in Wikipedia, but don’t necessarily have much in common with all incoming links. It is also difficult, for instance, for the crowd workers to ask meaningful multihop questions about highly technical entities like the IPv4 protocol. To alleviate this issue, we constrain the bridge entities to a set of manually curated pages in Wikipedia . Manually curated pages should solve the above problem. . Comparison Questions. In addition to questions collected using bridge entities, we also collect another type of multi-hop questions—comparison questions. The main idea is that comparing two entities from the same category usually results in interesting multi-hop questions. e.g., “Who has played for more NBA teams, Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant?” To increase the diversity of multi-hop questions, we also introduce a subset of yes/no questions in comparison questions. This complements the original scope of comparison questions by offering new ways to require systems to reason over both paragraphs. . Who doesn&#39;t love diversity in a question answering dataset? . Collecting Supporting Facts. To enhance the explainability of question answering systems, we want them to output a set of supporting facts necessary to arrive at the answer, when the answer is generated. To this end, we also collect the sentences that determine the answers from crowd workers. . Who doesn&#39;t like having a model explain how it came to a conclusion. Such a shame that we haven&#39;t more datasets like this which provokes the model to output the reason. I am not going to believe models are going to become less complex. And it is going to be very difficult to figure out the reasons for a decision based on poking the model&#39;s million parameters. But we could make the model tell us the reason for its decision na? . Lets dive into the data . . f = open(&#39;hotpot_train_v1.1.json&#39;,) # returns JSON object as # a dictionary training_data = json.load(f) print (len(training_data)) . 90447 . A bit strange. The size of the training data differs a bit from the sum of &quot;train-easy&quot;, &quot;train-medium&quot; and &quot;train-hard&quot;. . training_data_df=pd.DataFrame(training_data) training_data_df[&#39;level&#39;].value_counts() . medium 56814 easy 17972 hard 15661 Name: level, dtype: int64 . The number of easy questions have dropped to 17972 from the &#39;18089&#39; stated in the research paper. . training_data_df.groupby([&#39;level&#39;,&#39;type&#39;]).size() . level type easy bridge 14466 comparison 3506 hard bridge 12451 comparison 3210 medium bridge 46074 comparison 10740 dtype: int64 . In all 3 levels, comparison questions seem to make up about 18-20% of the total training size. . Let&#39;s also look at the type of answers in the dataset. . . This on first look, looks more diverse than Squad. But how come Yes/No only makes 6% wheen compared to around 18-20% comparison questions.

            "title": "Overcoming The Lexical Overlap Bias Using Predicate Argument Structures",
            "content": "Reviewing: Overcoming the Lexical Overlap Bias Using Predicate-Argument Structures . Starting with, this is a must read for anyone using transformer models (Bert, Xlnet) for solving NLP problems. It is no big secret that the transformer babies are kicking ass in pretty much all NLP scoreboards. But does kicking ass in nlp scoreboards equate to real life applicability. For last year or so, I have been here and there testing transformers on various other domains. And I will be honest, I was impressed but not all the time. Model makes a lot of mistakes that it seems counterintuitive to what they should have learned. This was a real problem and I searched for a solution and that’s when I came upon this paper. This paper claims it will help me with my problems. So, let’s dig deep. . In the “Introduction” itself the paper states this obvious fact- . “For instance, given the premise “Neil Armstrong was the first man who landed on the Moon”, the model may recognize the sentence “Moon was the first man who landed on the Neil Armstrong” as an entailing hypothesis or a plausible ending because it has a high lexical overlap with the premise.” . I understood it wasn’t just me alone getting transferability issues with Textual Entailment models. That was a ‘whew’! :P . Paper goes to compare itself with existing solutions which tries to address this problem and they all require a few things- . “new models or training procedures and the model’s complexity remains unchanged.” . Experimental Setup . Let’s discuss on the experimental setup which they used to check if they could overcome the lexical Bias. . They are evaluating 2 NLP Tasks- . 1) SWAG- “Given a premise that is a partial description about a situation, GCI is the task of reasoning about what is happening and predicting what might come next. SWAG models this task as a multiple-choice answer selection, in which the premise is given and the correct and three incorrect endings are presented as candidate answers.” . ” We created three different adversarial datasets based on the SWAG development set for evaluating the lexical overlap bias. These datasets evaluate the model’s understanding of (1) syntactic variations, (2) antonym relations, and (3) named entities in the presence of high lexical overlap” . Let me be honest with you, I haven’t done much work with Swag and the task seems very interesting from a NLP perspective. However, I haven’t been able to visualize, how any pretrained models from SWAG can be used for solving upstream business problems. But I am always open to new ideas that challenges my beliefs and in search for it. . 2) Natural Language Inference. Given a premise and a hypothesis, NLI is the task of determining whether the hypothesis entails, contradicts, or is neutral to the premise. . Now to overcome the Lexical Bias they wanted an evaluation dataset. Both the original SWAG &amp; MultiNLI dataset have these biases, so evaluating on their test datasets won’t be useful. . So, for SWAG, they created 3 evaluation datasets. According to them- . “These datasets evaluate the model’s understanding of (1) syntactic variations, (2) antonym relations, and (3) named entities in the presence of high lexical overlap.” . For NLI they are using an existing available dataset. Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems (HANS) dataset. This was a welcome surprise to me. . Their Approach . If you have noticed earlier, I had mentioned that their approach does not involve any change in the model or any other complexity. So, the only way they could solve this is using data augmentation. And if this problem can be solved like this, it’s a big win for all of us as this can be applied for any dataset of our choice. . They augment the training set by introducing predicate-argument structure using the ProbBank-style semantic role labelling model of Shi and Lin (2019) , which has the state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL-2009 dataset, to get predicate-argument structures.. This is how data example will look after augmentation- . . Models Used for Setup . They use bert, xlnet and Roberta models available from huggingface and then finetuned the models on Swag &amp; MultiNLI Dataset for the GCI &amp; NLI task respectively. . Results . . 1) Data augmentation is causing a substantial increase in “non-entailment” case for BERT &amp; XLNET. for Roberta accuracy seems to have gone down a bit. . 2) Clearly Roberta seems to be the most robust in case of MNLI with &amp; without data augmentation. Time to use Roberta more. . . 3) The results are more clear in the case of Swag Dataset. Augmentation has increased accuracy for all 3 evaluation datasets. Here, also RobertA is dominating the pack. . 4) It is to be concluded that models trained on MNLI are tending to have less issues when compared to the Swag ones. So, it seems that finetuning can have significant impact on the model’s understanding of natural language. . 5) The results on the HANS dataset can vary by a large margin using different random seeds during fine-tuning, e.g., BERT accuracy on the lexical overlap subset can vary from 6% to 54%. This is a bit disappointing that random seeds can have such a significant impact. It qualifies the need for more dissection of BERT models. . 6) They tried SRL using a different model (OPENIE which is less accurate). In this case also SRL resulted in an improvement in accuracy. . 7) They alse tested the augmentation on Roberta-large. Here also, there was an improvement when they checked on Adversial SWAG datasets. . 8) Luckily adding augmentation on test data did not yield any difference. It would have been a pain if it was the alternative. . Key Takeaways- . 1) We need to get more understanding of Transformer Models. We now seem to have research papers conflicting each other on their understanding of Transformer Models . 2) Better training and evaluation datasets are needed for NLP. SuperGlue is a big win, but we need more. . 3) For now, I am of the opinion that transformer models will need significant finetuning before they can adapt to a business scenario. .",
